# ESN Buddy Program

Welcome to the ESN Buddy Program GitHub organization! Here, we strive to make the transition for incoming international students smoother by connecting them with local buddies. This program fosters meaningful friendships, cultural exchange, and a supportive community that makes students feel at home from their first day.

## About the ESN Buddy Program

The ESN Buddy Program connects international students with local students based on shared interests, academic backgrounds, and fields of study. Our goal is to create a supportive environment where newcomers can easily adapt, feel included, and enjoy a network of friends from the start. Local buddies help international students adjust to life in a new country, offering insights into the local culture, academic environment, and social opportunities.

Through the Buddy Program, international students have someone to answer questions, explore the city, and attend social activities with, making their experience abroad fulfilling and memorable.

## Buddy Matcher Repository

The ESN Buddy Matcher is the primary project in our GitHub organization and serves as the backbone of the Buddy Program. This system:
	•	Matches local students with international students using criteria like shared interests, courses, and faculties.
	•	Creates meaningful connections that help newcomers integrate into academic and social life.
	•	Provides a streamlined, efficient solution for managing buddy pairings within higher education institutions.

Our Buddy Matcher repository is open for contributions! This is an ongoing project aimed at enhancing the quality of matches, improving the user experience, and supporting diverse community needs.
