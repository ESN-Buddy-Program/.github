# 🌏 ESN Groningen - BI Committee

Welcome to the ESN Groningen - BI Committee GitHub organization! 🎉 Here, we’re all about helping incoming international students feel at home by connecting them with friendly local buddies. Our mission? To foster new friendships, encourage cultural exchange, and build a supportive community that feels like family from day one. 🌈🤝

## About the ESN Buddy Program 💬

The ESN Buddy Program pairs international students with local students based on shared interests, academic backgrounds, and study fields. Our aim is to create a welcoming space where newcomers can easily adapt, feel included, and connect with new friends from the get-go. Local buddies offer tips on adjusting to life in a new country, insights into the local culture 🏡, academic support 📚, and social opportunities 🎉.

Through the Buddy Program, international students have someone to answer questions, explore the city 🏙️, and join in social activities, making their experience abroad memorable and enriching. 🌟

## 📌 Buddy Matcher Repository

The ESN Buddy Matcher is the main project in our GitHub organization and serves as the heart ❤️ of the Buddy Program! This system:

	•	Builds meaningful connections that help newcomers feel at home, both academically and socially.
	•	Provides an easy, efficient way to manage buddy pairings for institutions looking to support new students.
